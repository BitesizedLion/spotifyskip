> Tired of listening to the same songs? Well, Spotify Skip is the solution for you, with Spotify Skip's patented highly advanced technology... Just kidding, it's just some Javascript that interacts with Spotify's Web API and reads a playlist called "dead songs" (which you'll have to make by the way) and checks if you're playing that song, and if so it skips forward once.
